1. Introduction:

---

This C program serves as a demonstration of a basic stack implementation using an
array. A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are
added and removed from the same end, known as the 'top' of the stack.

---

2. Stack Operations:

---

The program allows users to perform the following operations:

   a. Push Element: Insert an element onto the stack.
   b. Pop Element: Remove and display the top element from the stack.
   c. Display Stack: Print all elements currently present in the stack.
   d. Exit: Terminate the program.

---

3. Data Structures:

---

- The stack is implemented as an integer array named 'stack' with a maximum
     size defined by the constant 'size'.
- The variable 'top' keeps track of the top of the stack.

---

4. How to Use:

---

   1. Run the program.
   2. Choose an option from the menu (1-4) to perform the desired operation.
   3. If choosing option 1 (Push Element), enter an integer to be pushed onto
      the stack.
   4. If choosing option 2 (Pop Element), the program will display the popped
      element.
   5. If choosing option 3 (Display Stack), the program will print all elements
      in the stack.
   6. Choosing option 4 (Exit) terminates the program.

---

4. Error Handling:

---

- The program checks for overflow conditions when pushing elements onto the
     stack.
- The program checks for underflow conditions when popping elements from the
     stack.

---

5. Dependencies:

---

- Standard Input/Output functions from the 'stdio.h' header.
- Memory allocation functions from the 'stdlib.h' header.
- Note: 'conio.h' is used for the 'getch()' function, but it is not
     portable and might not work on all compilers.

---

6. Note on Portability:

---

- The 'conio.h' header used for 'getch()' is not portable across different
     compilers. Consider using alternative methods for input without relying on
     'conio.h' for better portability.

---

7. Program Structure:

---

- The program is structured as a menu-driven loop in the 'main' function.
- A switch-case construct handles user choices and performs the associated
     stack operations.

---

1. Conclusion:

---
   This C program provides a basic implementation of a stack, allowing users to
   interactively push, pop, and display elements in the stack. It serves as an
   educational example of fundamental stack operations and array usage in C.
