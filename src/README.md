# Data Structures and Algorithms Source Code

The Data Structures and Algorithms written in the code files are uploaded as Source Code only. Please compile them using any IDE of your choice and then execute them.

All the Data Structures are implemented in [`data structure`](./data_structure/) directory.

All the Algorithms are implemented in [`algorithms`](./algorithms/) directory.

The Documentation to each data structure and algorithm program is extensively written in Markdown file with the Data Structure or Algorithm name.

For example, the documentation of implementation of Stack Data Structure in [`Stack Implementation Documentation`](../docs/stack_documentation.md)
